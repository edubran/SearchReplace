# SearchReplace

to use that search and replace tool, you just need to point the folder where your scripts are saved,
just type or point to your new path and execute,
all your scripts will be change

there is a SearchReplaceManual.py file, I use to execute it on sublime to change the paths on maya .ma files too and when I don't have a nuke license available,
